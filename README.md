Pathrise Project Overview

Business Understanding

This project aims to enhance the Pathrise mentorship program's effectiveness by predicting job placement outcomes. We focus on two main objectives:

1.	Classifying whether participants will secure a job.
   
2.	Predicting the timeframe for job acquisition.
   
Data Preprocessing and Exploration

The dataset underwent rigorous cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to understand the distributions and relationships in the data.

Predictive Modelling Approach

We utilized a range of classification and regression models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors, Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression and Support Vector Regression. For model optimization, we conducted hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

Model Evaluation and Selection

After rigorous testing and validation, the model that yielded the best performance in classification was Decision Tree Classifier, with an accuracy of 0.80 %. For regression, Support Vector Regression proved to be the most accurate with an RMSE of 107.0.

Conclusion and Implications

The insights gained from this project can significantly impact Pathrise's approach to supporting its participants. Our findings can help tailor the program to address specific needs, ultimately leading to more successful job placements.
